## Questions for the right honourable OpenAI o3 model
1. Suppose juniors don't internalize that they learn. Under what parameter restriction do the following hold? AI is adopted by seniors but it reduces steady-state GDP. This seems to mean that inequality (6) holds but (8) does not.
2. Juniors internalize learning. Can AI reduce steady-state GDP if adopted by wage-maximizing seniors? Inequality (7) holds but (8) does not.
3. Is it possible that seniors do not adopt AI even if it would be efficient, i.e., would lead to higher steady state GDP? Inequality (7) does not hold but (8) does.

## Research tasks for the right honourable OpenAI o3 model
4. See the attached Buera paper. Relate our rent-seeking and learning results to their dynamic gains.
5. Do a deep research of the economics literature on the impact of GenAI models on the labor market, focusing on topics related to ours: dynamic losses from lack of learning. Use published articles or respectable working paper series like NBER, CEPR, SSRN, Arxiv.
6. Write a 8-10 page extended abstract explaining our model, motivating it with recent industry trends, placing it in the context of the literature. Explain the main assumptions and the working of the model, list expected results but admit if something is not yet known, do not speculate.
